## Overview
We are all aware and grateful for the contributions of the workforce across the public and private sectors.
While most of the workforce self-report COVID-19 related symptoms and/or are taking precautions to the best of their abilities, it is critical to ensure their health is monitored daily and technology can play a huge role to facilitate this process. The Workforce Health Tracker application has been developed to ensure that the health of the staff across any organization is continued to be prioritized on a daily basis before they start with their work for the day.

The Workforce Health Tracker Application (WHT), is is a Mobile responsive survey driven Web-based application, developed to create visibility to daily monitor and track the health of the workforce. This will enable the administration/managers to make decisions around who should come to work and who should remain at home to take care of their health. This is necessary to ensure the staff is quarantined, tested, or treated promptly. This will also provide real-time visibility to optimize the deployment of staff at the workplace.

User Groups: The application is available in open source and can be used by anyone for their workforce across all industries and sectors, across the public and private sectors.

## Key Functionality and Features
The WHT can report their symptoms (associated with COVID-19, can be configured for other diseases) daily, before heading to work, by updating a symptom-checker survey web link shared with them via Whatsapp/email/telegram/SMS (as per the preference specified), automatically generated by the application. The Hospital administrators/ managers can use the dashboard to view the health of their staff and call and update the health status of the staff directly in case the survey has not been filled in for the day.
